# unicode-textwrapper
The original python TextWrapper library only works for US-ASCII characters. This project will inherit from that class and add some additional support for unicode characters with different East Asian Width properties. This will particularly benefit languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean which use full-width and wide variants, which are currently incorrectly formatted.
